# bookshelf-API
In this project I'll be creating a ReSTful API using Node.js. It'll be as simple as possible to show how easy is to put together an API using JavaScript, but at the same time I'll be aiming to score 3 at the [Richardson Maturity Model][1].

## Contents

* [What is ReST][c1]
* [Getting started][c2]
* [GET requests I. Routing and hooking up to the db][c3]
* [GET requests II. Refactoring request handlers into controllers][c4]
* [POST requests][c5]
